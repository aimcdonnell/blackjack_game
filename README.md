# Blackjack Game

## Description
A project taken from Jose Portilla's "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" course, which uses object-oriented programming. The blackjack rules have been simplified for this project.

## Simplified Rules
1) The player competes with a computer dealer
2) Player has a bankroll and places a bet
3) Player starts with 2 cards face up
4) Dealer starts with 1 card face up and 1 card face down
5) Player goes first in the gameplay
6) Player goal: get closer to a total value of 21 (sum of cards the player has) than the dealer does
7) Player action 1: Hit - receive another card
8) Player action 2: Stay - stop receiving cards
9) Game end option 1: The player keeps hitting and goes over 21 - bust and lost the bet
10) Game end option 2: The computer dealer hits and sum is higher than player sum and still under 21
11) Game end option 3: The computer dealer hits until they either beat the player or the dealer busts
12) Face cards - J, Q, K count as a value of 10
13) Aces count as either 1 or 11

## Technologies used
- JupyterLab
- Python

## Challenges encountered
- Deciding how to structure the classes (especially the methods required and in which class they should be contained)
